# CrewAI Custom Development

## Overview

CrewAI is an innovative framework designed to orchestrate role-playing, autonomous AI agents that collaborate to solve complex tasks. By enabling multiple agents to work together seamlessly, CrewAI fosters collaborative intelligence, making it an ideal solution for building sophisticated AI-driven applications, such as smart assistants, customer service platforms, and research teams.

## Project Intent

In this project, my goal is to extend the capabilities of CrewAI by developing new agents tailored to specific tasks. These agents will be customized to tackle unique challenges and enhance the overall functionality of the CrewAI framework. Whether it's through improving task execution, integrating new tools, or refining agent roles, this project aims to push the boundaries of what autonomous agents can achieve when working together.

## Features

- **Role-Based Agent Design:** Each agent is designed with a specific role, goals, and tools to perform tasks effectively.
- **Task Customization:** Define tasks for agents to execute, with clear objectives and expected outcomes.
- **Process Management:** Control how tasks are executed, whether sequentially or through more complex workflows.

## Getting Started
